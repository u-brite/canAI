## Genes of interest:

### Protocadherin family genes

![fnmol-13-00117-g002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40318061/183269955-5ef77dd8-103c-4374-b46c-bcce0e479824.jpg)

This gene family is expressed during brain development, but are also expressed in some tissues in adults.  It is thought that they may regulate cell differentiation, tissue regeneration and tissue maintenance.  They are sensitive to long range epigenetic silencing and hypermethylation of thesec PCDH clusters has been identified in breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancers, uterine leiomyosarcoma and leiomyoma, and in Wilms’ tumor.

### HOXA7 (Homeobox protein A7)

Higher level of HOXA7 has been shown is some studies to be associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor growth and metastasis.  It is thought that the mechanism may be involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

### SLC45A2

SLC45A2-AMACR gene fusion has been shown to be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer recurrence, metastases, and/or death.
