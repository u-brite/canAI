Feature extraction methods used to select n best features:
-Recursive Feature Selection (RFE) with a decision tree classifier aims to build a decision tree using all features and eliminate the least relevant features at each step until n features remain. 
-Univariate Feature Selection performs univariate statistical tests that measure the dependency between a feature and the target. The features with the highest scores show a greater dependence and are considered most important in the model. Chi-squared and F-regression are 2 types of univariate statistical tests.
-Extra Trees Classification, an ensemble machine learning algorithm, builds multiple decision trees using randomly selected features and keeps the ones that aim to optimize the model.

Data was split using train_test_split so that 20% could be used for testing. Label_binarize package was used to binarize the y-variable.
