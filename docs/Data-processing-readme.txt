•	Level 3 processed RNA-sequencing (Gene counts) and DNA methylation (Illumnia Human methylation 450) TCGA Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PRAD) data were downloaded from UCSC Xena (https://xena.ucsc.edu/).  
•	The downloaded data were then processed to remove the genes if there is more than 30% NA’s in the samples. 
•	Followed by identifying top, 1000 gene expression and DNA methylation was selected based on the variability within each samples.
•	This served as our data to perform various machine learning approach.
